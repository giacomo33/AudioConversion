# AudioConversion
.NET Core App with Docker Integration and Kubenetes. This particular project also shows how to integrate a .NET Core app into a Linux Host to access various exceutables. This could be a powerful tool to utilise the underlying host OS. It also handles large file uploading by streaming a file into the controller instead buffering the file in its entirety, without compromising disk space and memory allocation. 

Project illustrates some best pratices implementation:

1.  Domain Driven Design
2.  Use of Swagger
3.  Azure Application Insights as logging tool
4.  Health check for Kubernetes Orchestrator
5.  Service Bus Integration
6.  Unit testing an all controllers and models
7.  Background Service implementation for potential long running tasks
8.  Naming conventions used 

### Technology Stack used
